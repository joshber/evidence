Evidence is a research studio.

~~We observe (investigate?) human behavior (in the wild) to anticipate and swerve what comes next.~~

We observe humans in their natural habitats to anticipate and swerve what comes next.

We think of ourselves as dramaturgs: we give form to how the action unfolds. (open-ended, minimally constrained, room for chance)

We conduct self-initiated research â€¦

Our core expertise lies in health and well-being, food, mobility, education, and financial behavior. FIXME: INDIGENOUS?
But the best briefs are those we never saw coming.

Evidence was founded in 2017 by anthropologist and knowledge scientist Josh Berson.

We are based in Berlin with global remit.
