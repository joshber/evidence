# Evidence is a research studio.

(contact link at the top — maybe fixed position? — show the address, no icon?)

We help organizations integrate rigorous research into their own culture.

We provide research strategy, with an emphasis on problems stemming from value conflicts under social acceleration.

We design new ways of observing human behavior in the wild.

We stage seminars and retreats for individuals looking to become more rigorous in their creative lives.

We design residencies for social scientists, writers, artists, and others with a research-centered creative practice.

And — soon — we’ll publish books: the most thoughtful and unexpected works of research writing appearing anywhere in the world today.

Evidence was founded in 2017 by anthropologist and knowledge scientist Josh Berson.
We are based in Berlin with global remit.
