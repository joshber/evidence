<p class="fadein">Evidence is a research studio.</p>

<p class="fadein delay1">We observe humans in their natural habitats to anticipate and swerve what comes next.</p>

<p class="fadein delay2">We think of ourselves as dramaturgs: we give form to how the action unfolds
in an open-ended way that leaves room for chance.</p>

<p class="fadein delay3">Our core expertise lies in health and well-being, food, mobility, education, and financial behavior.
But the best briefs are those we never saw coming.</p>

<p class="fadein delay4">Evidence was founded in 2017 by anthropologist Josh Berson.</p>

<p class="fadein delay5">We operate with global remit.</p>
