<p class="fadein delay0">Evidence is a research studio.</p>

<p class="fadein delay1">We design new ways of observing human behavior in the wild.</p>

<p class="fadein delay2">We help organizations of all shapes and sizes integrate rigorous research into their own culture.</p>

<p class="fadein delay3">We conduct self-initiated research on themes ranging from food security to
<a href="http://goo.gl/Qn2HTI">the environmental determinants of mental health</a>.</p>

~~FIXME WE CONDUCT SELF-INITIATED RESEARCH ON THEMES RANGING FROM FOOD SECURITY TO SOCIAL ACCELERATION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ??? Our work addresses the most urgent themes of the day, things like FIXME THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS? CONFLICTS OVER LAND USE? food security, social acceleration, Native sovereignty, and mental health.~~
